            <p class="lead">Throughout researching ways of proving my hypothesis if it is to be true, in terms of collecting different ways to collect primary data, my primary methods were:<br><br>
              <ul>
	               <li><i><b>Interviews:</b></i> Transcription and mp3 recording of interview</li><br>
                 <li><i><b>Observation:</b></i> I Went down to the local park and observed number of females playing Aussie Rules Football compared to when I used to play junior football when I only saw one female play Aussie Rules Football in my whole entire years of playing junior football.</li><br>
                 <li><i><b>Survey:</b></i> I gathered data in a google forms online survey from females that play Aussie Rules football at all levels that answered why they play football and if the AFLW has caused them to further pursue the sport.</li><br>

              <p class="lead">From the google spreadsheets document, their is a rendered form of the data that I collected from females entering data in from the google form that I created.
                Please note that 13 people answered the survey and those 13 players presumably play in the Victorian Ameteur football association and play for the club Old Scotch Football club.<br><br>
                Out of the 13 females that entered in data, I considered only two of those 13 people to have entered unreasonable data, meaning that I will not validate the data from those people that answered what I thought were “silly” responses. The primary data that I collected is raw, unrecognised facts and figures of which it is up for interpretation.<br><br>
                Out of all the primary data collected, the many methods of which I used to collect the data were surveys, observation and interviews with coaches of the Old Scotch football club womens side and an interview with my sister who is new to playing Australian Rules Football.<br><br>

            <b>Me:</b><i> “Hi coach, do you give consent for the following interview to go ahead, and do you approve that the data I will gather for this interview will be interpreted for data manipulation in response to the findings for my hypothesis? If you give consent, how many seasons of female football have you coached?</i><br><br>
            <b>Coach:</b><i> “Hi Tom,I give consent to answer your questions! I have coached 3 seasons of female football all of which I have enjoyed a lot! I am the women’s coach for the Old Scotch Football club!”</i><br><br>
            <b>Me:</b><i> “Very Good! Out of all of those 3 seasons that you have coached, what have you observed about the increase of female participation with playing the sport?”</i><br><br>
            <b>Coach:</b><i> “In my first season of coaching, it was before the inclusion of the AFL women’s competition and at our footy club (Old Scotch), numbers were fairly low and we were struggling to fill just one side! After the AFLW was introduced, we had many different girls and their friends wanting to play football and participation numbers went through the roof at our club! If I had to draw a conclusion to this...  if the AFLW did not exist, then I don’t think we would have many females really wanting to play football!”</i><br><br>
