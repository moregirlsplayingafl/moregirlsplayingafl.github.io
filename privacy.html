              <p>Throughout all of the data that I have used as secondary data, I acknowledge that all of the resources that I have used from other domains is not data that I have gathered as it is data that those organisations have gathered as primary data. Throughout the usage of those resources I have used them for data interpretation, as I have cited their work and data gathered as I have used that data for personal interpretation for researching whether the introduction of the AFLW has led to higher participation rates amongst girls playing Australian Rules Football at all levels. Where I have used their data, I have acknowledged their findings via Scotch bibliography as I have referenced all of the data sources through my referencing page on this MMOS.</p><br><br>
              <h4>Protection of rights</h4><br>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Software Security controls :</b> This includes having passwords on cloud systems to access primary data gathered. I also used the HTTPS protocol to ensure that the data that I collected was in a secure transmission stage.</li>
                <li><b>Physical security controls :</b> When collecting data I locked all of the doors at my house where my computer is located. This means that people who enter the room with unauthorised entry will need a key to enter the room where my computer is located.</li><br><br>

              <h4>Meeting legal requirements</h4>
              <p>Before participants participated in the survey that was used for this sites Key findings as Primary data, they had to read a Participation Information Statement/Consent Form and then they had to agree with the terms and conditions of the survey. Once participants clicked “I agree” on the survey then that meant that they gave consent to submit required data relating to my topic. This comes under the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) of which I abided by sections 13,14 and 15. When I collected the data I informed participants that the data will be kept confidentially and that NO DATA will be shared with any third parties. This data will be displayed as information in this MMOS.</p>
